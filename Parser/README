Files:
* SCFParser.py - a simplified version of SCFParser.exe written for this project.
* SCFFile.tlv - the SCFFile provided by professor as an example of input.

- Run SCFParser.py from the command line, providing it with a .tlv file to parse.
- It will parse the fields in the Header and Body from the file, the print out a short report.

- The report is printed to stndout and is hard coded to include this information:

	Parse CTL File
	--------------

	Rev: tag:1 len:2 value:b'\x01\x02'
	Header length: tag:2 len:2 value:312

	Start CTL Records
	-----------------

	--- CTL Record: 1 ---

	Record Length: tag:2 len:2 value:1147
	Subject Name: tag:2 len:55 value:b'CN=gigantic-6.cisco.com;OU=VTG;O=Alpha;L=SJ;ST=CA;C=US\x00'
	Subject Function/Role: tag:2 len:2 value:b'\x00\x00'
	Subject Certificate Issuer Name: tag:2 len:55 value:b'CN=gigantic-6.cisco.com;OU=VTG;O=Alpha;L=SJ;ST=CA;C=US\x00'

	--- CTL Record: 2 ---
	...<Report continues for each CTL Record Parsed>...

- Fields can be added or removed from the report by changing the corresponding 'in_report' boolean for the field in HEADER_FIELDS or BODY_FIELDS.

-Static Analysis results: Used sonarqube (https://www.sonarqube.org/) for the static analysis here. It directed me to remove 5 commented out lines, and make sure that the python argparse module was being used apropriatly for user input. Will include screenshots from this as documention in our report.
