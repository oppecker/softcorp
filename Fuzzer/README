Files for Fuzzing:
* make_fuzz_files.py - python script to generate modfied versions of SCFFile.tlv to use for fuzzing SCFParser.exe
* fuzz_template/SCFFile.tlv - Provided by professor, used here as a template/seed to modify for fuzzing.
* fuzz_files/ - directory to store .tlv files created by make_fuzz_files.py
* fuzz_files.py - Runs fuzzing test, loops through fuzz_files/ directory and runs SCFParser.exe on each file it finds there.
	Then prints results to console.

Application under Test: (included in repo for convenience)
* SCFParser.exe - Main executable.
* __MACOSX/ - files required by SCFParser.exe
* libeay32.dll - file required by SCFParser.exe
* ssleay32.dll - file required by SCFParser.exe


To preform fuzzing test on SCFParser.exe:
1) Run make_fuzz_files.py to create .tlv files to fuzz test with. (by default 20 are created, can by modifed by command line)
2) Run fuzz_files.py to perform the fuzzing tests with created files.
3) Examine output on commandline to analyze the results.
